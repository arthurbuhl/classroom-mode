## Mission

Freecodecamp started out as an individual experience. But more and more teachers are using it to teach groups of students at a time. There is also an increasing number of study groups forming around freecodecamp. However, freecodecamp was not built with the group experience in mind. The goal of this project is to serve teachers and study groups.

## Vision

> It’s 10pm at night, you’re in a remote town, you should be able to log on virtually and code with a community.

We envision a multitude of communities around the world empowering themselves to learn coding. Our goal is to foster community learning.
